# Finding-lane-for-autonomous-vehicles
The Main theme of this Project is to Provide a lane for the vehicle,Where there are no obstacles.We provide
video as an input,the algorithm selects a path where there are no obstacles in the lane.
We have Done the research about Hough trasform and canny edge algorithm for lane detection in autonomous
vehicles.
 Hough transform is a feature extraction method used in image analysis.Canny edge is an edge detecion
operator.
